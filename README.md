# calculator

This is going to be a simple four function calculator
that can evaluate an expression containing the four basic
operators (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and dision).
There are going to be 16 HTML buttons that will correspond to
digits (0-9), the four basic operators, the clear button, and the evaluate button.
Basic functionality will be completed when the calculator can output
an answer from integers but I hope to add floating point capability as well.
